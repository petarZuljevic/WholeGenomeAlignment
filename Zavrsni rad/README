Genome alignment is one of the major problems in bioinformatics that still have not been effectively resolved. 
Although exact algorithms which would give optimal solution are known they are not used becouse of their long running time.


In this thesis is described tool for genome alignment realized like multithreaded application written in C++.
Tool is based on locating identical interval regions in given sequences by using suffix array, and after that 
by using Smith-Waterman algorithm on regions in which MUMs were not found.
